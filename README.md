# BingoRPG

This is a RPG-based bingo game for my OOP Activity. Purely written in Java. The UI is made with ```javax.swing```
and the use of 
```java.awt```

No external dependencies needed. Just a running ```jvm17``` is needed
to run the program.

If you want to try or test this, you are going to compile this on your own.


External Libraries:
    
    1. com.google.gson - for json reading capabilities.
